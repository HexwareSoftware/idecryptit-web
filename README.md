# iDecryptIt Website (`idecryptit-web`)

The [iDecryptIt website](https://idecryptit.com/) is designed to facilitate a one-stop shop for information regarding the firmwares used in iPhone OS, iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS.

## Running a Copy

In order to run a copy of the website, you must first have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
Then install `yarn` if you don't have it:

```bash
> npm i -g yarn
```

Then you can run the following:

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/colejohnson66/iDecryptItWeb
> cd iDecryptItWeb
> yarn install
> yarn dev
```

After launching the server, a message will appear in the console telling you the server is "live":
```
ready - started server on http://localhost:3000
```
Enter that URL into your favorite browser to begin browsing.

## Roadmap

Ultimately, this website is designed to be a place for all my knowledge regarding Apple's iDevice platform.
