                The S5L8720 is the processor used in the {{#link "/devices/ipod/2g"}}iPod touch 2G{{/link}}.
                It runs at 533&nbsp;MHz.
            </p>

            <h2 id="headingExploits">Exploits</h2>
            <p>
                The S5L8720 is one of the few {{#link "/devices"}}iDevice{{/link}} processors to have an <em>untethered bootrom</em> exploit;
                The advantage of a bootrom level exploit is the ability to jailbreak <em>any</em> device utilizing the processor, regardless of the version of iPhone OS/iOS installed.
                By having an <em>un</em>tethered bootrom level exploit, a computer is not needed to assist in booting the device.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are currently two bootrom level exploits: {{#link "https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/0x24000_Segment_Overflow"}}24kPwn (0x24000 Segment Overflow){{/link}} (untethered; old bootrom only) and {{#link "https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Usb_control_msg(0xA1,_1)_Exploit"}}usb_control_msg(0xA1, 1){{/link}} (tethered; both bootroms).
            </p>

            <h2 id="headingBootroms">Bootroms</h2>
            <p>
                The S5L8720 is one of two processors to have two different bootroms;
                The other being the {{#link "/processors/s5l8920"}}S5L8920{{/link}}.
                Roughly seven months after the release of the 24kPwn (0x24000 Segment Overflow), Apple released updated {{#link "/devices/ipod/2g"}}iPod touch 2G{{/link}}s containing a newer bootrom that was no longer vulnerable;
                This closed the hole that allowed an untethered bootrom level exploit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Later, a new exploit, <code>usb_control_msg(0xA1, 1)</code> (sometimes referred to as "steaks4uce") was discovered.
                This exploit, when combined with a kernel exploit, allows a <em>tethered</em> jailbreak on newer bootroms.
